# Streaming App
Create and edit streams from you device with your Google Login and OBS Studio.

1. To start, open 3 terminal windows.
2. Initiate the database. Go to api folder and run npm start.
3. Go to client folder and run 'npm start'
4. Go to your rtmpserver folder and run 'node index.js' to start the server

**Note** Steps 2-4 should be running simultaneously

When all three are running, go to the application, Login with Google and create a stream!
Ensure that your OBS settings are configured to the ID of your newly created stream.
